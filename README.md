### Astropy Addons

Astropy Addons is a self-built package with the intention of acting as a "wrapper" to work with FITS-image calculations for class work in astrophysics. As the name implies, this package depends on the "Astropy" library.

Two folders exist currently: 
* "astrophys", which is my first draft of the package, made concurrently with work I was doing at the time.
* "astropyaddons", which is a more polished version with the intent of separating class responsibilities and clearly planning class responsibilities.

The package is currently still WIP.
